## Hi friend ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fion (fee-on), a 4th year computer engineering student at UWaterloo. Besides working on interesting software projects, I love sports, books, the colour green, the Miata NA, and photography! 
<br>
<br>
I've had a couple of internships working with primarily web development, and am now looking to learn more about backend development and product management. On that note, I am currently looking for 2026 new grad opportunities!
<br>
<br>
ðŸŒ± Feel free to reach out at [fion_lin@outlook.com](mailto:fion_lin@outlook.com), I'd love to chat :D
